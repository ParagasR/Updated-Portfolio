Ryan's Portfolio
================

Link to live website: [Ryan's Portfolio](https://paragasr.github.io/My-Portfolio/)

This is Ryan's skeleton portfolio page. It is not a complete project and is just the foundation for a completed project that will
be used in the future. Basic functions of this website are links to works done in the past, temp cards for future works, contact information, and 
my resume is linked as well.
